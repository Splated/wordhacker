<b>How to play WordHacker</b><br>
<br>
Each player picks a secret password of five letters consisting of all different letters.<br>
The object of the game is to correctly guess the other player's password first. Players take turns guessing five letter words, the number of letters that are in both the guessed word, and the password are printed on the right. The positions of the letters don't matter, for example:<br>
SLUGS  	0 <-- none of the letters are in the password. <br>
POWER  	2 <-- 2 letters are in the enemy password.<br>
CORKY 	5 <-- all 5 letters are correct but in the wrong order.<br>
Enemy Pasword is "ROCKY"<br>
<br>
Use the letters along the sides to help narrow down your enemy password.<br>
<br>
Click on the letter to cycle between: eliminate (grey), Confirm (green) and Normal (White).<br>
<br>
The Hint Button will pick a random word using the letters you confirmed and eliminated, and tell you how many words are possible with your letters.<br>
<br>
Tips:<br>
Word with double letters cannot be the password but can be used for guesses and the double letters are not counted.<br>
The word EERIE only has 3 letters E R I, use this to your advantage.<br>
